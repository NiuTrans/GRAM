# A Generative Foundation Reward Model (GRAM)

This repository contains the code and released models for our paper [GRAM: A Generative Foundation Reward Model for Reward Generalization üìù](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14175). We propose a more effective approach to reward model training by combining both labeled and unlabeled data. Our method introduces a generative reward model that first learns from a large corpus of unlabeled data and is then fine-tuned with supervised data. Please find all the released model checkpoints at [this link ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/collections/wangclnlp/gram-68452f737e53feeef4202d9b). To develop a reward model tailored to a specific task or domain, we recommend fine-tuning the released GRAM model using task-specific preference data. This strategy mitigates the dependence on large-scale human annotations while maintaining strong performance on the target task.

## üÜï Changelog
- [2025/9/1] We released the second-generation generative foundation reward model, GRAM-R^2, which incorporates reward reasoning and generates rationales before predicting preference labels. When using LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct as the backbone, the GRAM-R^2 can achieve 85.7% accuracy on RM-Bench. Furthermore, test-time scaling strategies (e.g., majority voting) can be integrated to further enhance performance. More details are provided in this [README](./extensions/GRAM-RR/README.md) and our [paper](). 
- [2025/6/17] We trained GRAM using Qwen3 and achieved a score of 71.4 on JudgeBench with Qwen3-14B, significantly outperforming two strong open-source baselines: Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward and Skywork-Reward-Gemma-2-27B-v0.2. 
- [2025/6/1] We performed additional data cleaning, such as the removal of overly long or corrupted samples, to help GRAM achieve better performance. The processed dataset is available at this [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangclnlp/GRAM-pre-training-566k).
- [2025/5/1] Our paper has been accepted by ICML 2025!

## Preparing Models and Datasets

### Datasets

#### Pre-Training

Each item of the dataset for GRAM pre-training should include at least two keys:

- `instruction`: any prompt in following template:
  ```text
  [User Question]
  {your prompt here}
  ```
- `input`: the input for above prompt, can be empty if there is not.
- `output`: two responses in following template:
  ```text
  [The Start of Assistant A's Answer]
  {answer of assistant A}
  [The End of Assistant A's Answer]

  [The Start of Assistant B's Answer]
  {answer of assistant B}

```


#### Fine-Tuning

Each item of the dataset for GRAM fine-tuning should include at least two keys:

- `instruction`: any prompt with corresponding two responses in following template:
  ```text
  Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that follows the user's instructions and answers the user's question better.
  Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of their responses. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible.
  Please directly output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "A" if assistant A is better, "B" if assistant B is better.

  [User Question]
  {your prompt here}

  [The Start of Assistant A's Answer]
  {answer of assistant A}
  [The End of Assistant A's Answer]

  [The Start of Assistant B's Answer]
  {answer of assistant B}
  [The End of Assistant B's Answer]

  #Preferred:
  ```

## Training Scripts

### Pre-Training

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_full/qwen3_pre_training_rm.yaml
```

### Fine-Tuning
```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_full/qwen3_fine_tuning_rm.yaml
```

At this stage, the released models can be directly fine-tuned on your own labeled, task- or domain-specific preference data to obtain a reward model that is well-adapted to the target application.



### Evaluation

```bash
cd evaluation/
ckpt_path=/path/to/your/model
```

  ```bash
  python gram_eval.py -i allenai_reward_bench/filtered.json -m $ckpt_path -o $ckpt_path/reward-bench.res
  echo -e "RewardBench Evaluation Summary:\n"
  python get_reward_bench_score.py $ckpt_path/reward-bench.res

  python thu_keg_rm_bench/compute_accuracy.py $ckpt_path/reward-bench.res
  ```

## Using GRAM in RLHF

### Computing Rewards of a pair of Samples

```python
def compute_pair_rewards(response_a, response_b):
    # compute rewards for response_a and response_b as in the demo `evaluation/gram_demo.py`
    ...
    return reward_response_a, reward_response_b
```

### PPO

When applying GRAM to PPO training, we first generate a **reference response** and then compute a reward score using GRAM, which quantifies **how much better the sampled response is compared to the reference**. This score serves as the reward signal during PPO training. The basic idea, using the difference between the sampled and reference responses as the reward, has been shown effective in prior baseline methods. Additionally, inspired by [*ReMax*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10505), we can use **greedy search** to construct the reference response. The detailed procedure is described below:

```python
def ppo():
    # Init dataset and model
    ...
    ref_model, policy_model, reward_model, value_model = ...
    # Sample from policy model: generate with greedy search first, then sample as normal with top-p/top-k
    response_greedy_search = greedy_search(policy_model, query)
    response_normal = generate(policy_model, query, top_p=..., top_k=...)
    _, reward_response_normal = compute_pair_rewards(response_greedy_search, response_normal)
    # Compute logits from ref_model, values from value_model and update with PPO loss
    ...
```

### List-wise Response Ranking
A common use case for list-wise response ranking is best-of-n sampling, where the goal is to select the single best response from a list. This can be accomplished using GRAM with a linear search approach, as illustrated below. To support parallel computation and improve efficiency, we also incorporate optimization strategies such as divide-and-conquer.

```python
def list_wise_response_ranking():
    # Init dataset and model
    ...
    # Generate from model
    responses = [response0, response1, responses2, ...]
    # Compute rewards and choose one with highest score
    best_response = response0
    for response in responses[1:]:
        score_a, score_b = compute_pair_rewards(best_response, response)
        if score_a < score_b:
           best_response = response

    return best_response
```
