# A Generative Foundation Reward Model (GRAM)

This repository contains the code and released models for our paper [GRAM: A Generative Foundation Reward Model for Reward Generalization 📝](). We propose a more effective approach to reward model training by combining both labeled and unlabeled data. Our method introduces a generative reward model that first learns from a large corpus of unlabeled data and is then fine-tuned with supervised data. Please find all the released model checkpoints at [this link 🤗]().
